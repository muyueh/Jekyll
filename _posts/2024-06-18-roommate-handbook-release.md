We finally published the long-requested **Cats vs Dogs Roommate Handbook**, a 36-page guide packed with routines that help blended households thrive. The booklet started as a volunteer-driven document, but this week our editorial guild polished the copy, added diagrams, and uploaded print-ready files.

Key chapters include:

- **Space Mapping:** Worksheets to divide sunbeams, sofa arms, and window ledges with fairness in mind.
- **Communication Rituals:** Scripts for introducing new pets, hosting visitor drop-ins, and managing holiday schedules.
- **Maintenance Logs:** Checklists for grooming swaps, shared toy libraries, and emergency contacts.

We printed twenty proof copies at the local risograph studio and sent them home with beta readers. Their annotations will feed into the second edition, which already has a waitlist.
