Coach Priya led a blended coaching clinic today where agility captains and obedience mentors swapped techniques for the first time. We structured the day around micro-sessions so every participant could both teach and learn.

Morning drills tackled **precision cues**. Cat specialists introduced clicker timing patterns that emphasize patience, while dog trainers unpacked body-language mirroring to keep canine athletes centered.

After lunch we dove into analytics. Our in-house data volunteer projected tracker metrics for four active teams, highlighting how mixed-mentor pods improved completion scores by 12% over the last quarter. The clinic ended with an open Q&A and a resource swap featuring annotated drill sheets for home practice.

Feedback cards averaged 4.8 out of 5, with recurring requests for a follow-up clinic focused on sensory enrichment. Challenge accepted.
