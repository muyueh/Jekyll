Our weekly Diplomacy Lounge turned the debate from speed to empathy. We paired each cat guardian with a dog handler for a guided listening exercise, passing around a deck of scenario cards inspired by common household stand-offs.

Highlights from the roundtable:

1. **Food truce frameworks** — Cat guardians shared how elevated dining stations ease tension during family-style meals. Dog handlers responded with puzzle feeder demonstrations that kept paws occupied and away from feline bowls.
2. **Quiet hours** — We drafted a shared "noise charter" where nighttime zoomies are traded for morning door-greeting duties.
3. **Shared scent projects** — Everyone decorated fabric squares with species-safe herbs so residents could swap them like pen pal letters.

We closed the session by recording testimonials for a forthcoming case study on multispecies roommates. The consensus: structured conversation plus snacks equals tangible peace.
