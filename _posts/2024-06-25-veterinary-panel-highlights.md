Our June veterinary panel drew a standing-room-only crowd. We welcomed Dr. Singh (feline orthopedics), Dr. Morales (canine cardiology), and Dr. Keane (nutrition science) for a lightning round of audience questions.

**Top takeaways**

- Early joint screenings are vital for both agility cats and flyball dogs. Dr. Singh demoed a five-minute mobility check anyone can do at home.
- Heart-rate variability monitors offer surprising insights into recovery windows. Dr. Morales brought sample data showing how post-training cuddle sessions calm dogs faster than solo crate time.
- Shared treat jars can work if labeled clearly. Dr. Keane recommended protein-forward biscuits for dogs and freeze-dried salmon cubes for cats to balance caloric density.

We captured the session on video and will publish clips alongside transcripts next week. Attendees left with tote bags stuffed with hydration mixes, pill pockets, and the newest edition of our health tracking worksheet.
