We opened the studio at dawn to film a new agility reel and both squads arrived with energy to spare.

The cat course leaned into vertical play. We stacked modular towers and suspended feather toys at varying heights so each leap tested balance as well as reach. Meanwhile the dog lane focused on interval sprinting, swapping weave poles for scent-coded hurdles to keep noses and paws working together.

After three rounds we compared stopwatch data:

- **Cats:** Average lap time of 41.2 seconds with a 96% clean run rate.
- **Dogs:** Average lap time of 38.5 seconds with an 88% clean run rate.

The numbers confirm what we felt on the floor—dogs beat the clock but cats never clipped a barrier. We wrapped by interviewing participants about warm-up routines, giving us raw quotes for an upcoming newsletter feature on cross-species stretching.
