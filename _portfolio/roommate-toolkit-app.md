Inspired by our printed handbook, the Roommate Toolkit App syncs calendars, feeding routines, and enrichment ideas across devices. Guardians can assign tasks, upload progress photos, and log mood notes that become shareable reports for trainers or veterinarians.

Beta metrics show a 35% uptick in on-time medication reminders when households adopt the app. We are prepping for a public launch with multilingual support and push notification templates tuned to both cat and dog circadian rhythms.
