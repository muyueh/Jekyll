We transformed five downtown plazas into collaborative mural stations, sketching giant cats and dogs that commuters could color in on their way to work. Each mural featured QR codes linking to micro-surveys so participants could log their vote and share a quick story about their cohabiting pets.

By sunset we had logged 1,482 survey responses, plus hundreds of social posts tagged with our campaign hashtag. The aggregated stories now fuel our editorial calendar for the next quarter.
