The Paws & Effect Podcast blends documentary interviews with field recordings from shelters, agility meets, and cat cafes. Season one spans six episodes covering topics such as interspecies communication, historic working dogs, and the rise of feline parkour crews.

We reached 12,000 downloads in the first month, and listener surveys show a near-even split between self-identified "team cat" and "team dog" subscribers. Show notes now double as resource guides for our community workshops.
